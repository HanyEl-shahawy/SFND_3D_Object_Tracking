# SFND 3D Object Tracking

Welcome to the final project of the camera course. By completing all the lessons, you now have a solid understanding of keypoint detectors, descriptors, and methods to match them between successive images. Also, you know how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework. And finally, you know how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space. Let's take a look at our program schematic to see what we already have accomplished and what's still missing.

In this final project, you will implement the missing parts in the schematic. To do this, you will complete four major tasks: 
1. First, you will develop a way to match 3D objects over time by using keypoint correspondences. 
2. Second, you will compute the TTC based on Lidar measurements. 
3. You will then proceed to do the same using the camera, which requires to first associate keypoint matches to regions of interest and then to compute the TTC based on those matches. 
4. And lastly, you will conduct various tests with the framework. Your goal is to identify the most suitable detector/descriptor combination for TTC estimation and also to search for problems that can lead to faulty measurements by the camera or Lidar sensor. In the last course of this Nanodegree, you will learn about the Kalman filter, which is a great way to combine the two independent TTC measurements into an improved version which is much more reliable than a single sensor alone can be. But before we think about such things, let us focus on your final project in the camera course. 

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* Git LFS
  * Weight files are handled using [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * This must be compiled from source using the `-D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON` cmake flag for testing the SIFT and SURF detectors.
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level project directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./3D_object_tracking`.

## Match 3D Objects
matchBoundingBoxes function takes the previous and current data frames and provides the ids of matched ROIs according to highest number of keypoint correspondances.

## Compute Lidar-based TTC
computeTTCLidar function uses matched lidar points from bounding boxes to calculate ttc after removing outliers by taking the mean of the first 50 (configurable) closest points.

## Assosciate Keypoint Correspondances with Bounding Boxes
clusterKptMatchesWithROI function shrink the bounding box from YOLO first then compute mean & std of matched keypoints distances. Using the first confidence interval, the matches are added to boundingBox structure.

## Compute Camera-based TTC
computeTTCCamera function computes ttc using keypoint correspondances. It filters keypoints which have distance ratio less than 100 (configurable). The median of the sorted distance ratio is taken to deal with outliers.

## Evaluation 1
In some frames the ttc from lidar is very deviated from camera's and also looks unplausible. This is mainly because of outliers the way they are eliminated, would be better to use madian instead.

## Evaluation 2
Running several combination of detector/describtor shown that these combinations as the best choice for our purpose of detecting keypoints on vehicles are: SHITOMASI/BRISK
SHITOMASI/BRIEF
SHITOMASI/ORB
